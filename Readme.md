# Sust Football Tournament Management System

## Introduction
Football tournaments are organized annually by SUST, but the record-keeping system is still done on pen and paper. To modernize this, I created a database that digitally stores all information about the tournaments, including details about players, teams, referees, matches, and scores.


## ER Diagram
There are 8 entities in the system. These are â€“

- Match
- Player
- Team
- Score
- Penalty
- Referee
- Punishment
- Stadium
